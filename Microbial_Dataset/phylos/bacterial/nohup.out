RAxML can't, parse the alignment file as phylip file 
it will now try to parse it as FASTA file

IMPORTANT WARNING: Alignment column 2987 contains only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data
IMPORTANT WARNING: Alignment column 3795 contains only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data
IMPORTANT WARNING: Alignment column 4263 contains only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 3 columns that contain only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data.
Normally these columns should be excluded from the analysis.

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
undetermined columns removed is printed to file repCRbact_align_seqs.reduced


Using BFGS method to optimize GTR rate parameters, to disable this specify "--no-bfgs" 


Alignment has 3 completely undetermined sites that will be automatically removed from the input data

Alignment has 3084 distinct alignment patterns

Proportion of gaps and completely undetermined characters in this alignment: 93.93%

RAxML rapid bootstrapping and subsequent ML search

Using 1 distinct models/data partitions with joint branch length optimization



Executing 100 rapid bootstrap inferences and thereafter a thorough ML search 

All free model parameters will be estimated by RAxML
GAMMA model of rate heterogeneity, ML estimate of alpha-parameter

GAMMA Model parameters will be estimated up to an accuracy of 0.1000000000 Log Likelihood units

Partition: 0
